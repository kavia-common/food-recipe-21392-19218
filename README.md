# Food Recipe Project

This workspace contains the React frontend of the Food Recipe app. The project also includes a FastAPI backend and a PostgreSQL schema in sibling workspaces.

Quick start:
- Backend: run FastAPI on port 8000 (default). See BackendAPIService/README.md in its workspace.
- Frontend: npm install && npm start, then open http://localhost:3000.
- Configure REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL or VITE_API_BASE_URL to point to backend (defaults to http://localhost:8000).
